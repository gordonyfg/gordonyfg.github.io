**Description:** A high-resolution, non-contact measurement instrument that reveals 3D structures with sub-micron precision. Designed for wafer process optimization, it integrates hardware and software seamlessly.  
**Role & Contribution:**  
- Contributed to the proof-of-concept by integrating piezoelectric linear stages, camera sensors, light sources, and optical elements with software including Windows drivers, Python GUIs, and GPU-accelerated data processing.
- Developed LRU-like caching systems to optimize memory usage and support real-time 3D data processing.
- Created algorithms for precise profiling and visualization of intricate 3D structures.

#### **High-Density/Precision Thermal Mat**  
**Description:** An intelligent multi-point temperature sensor array with high accuracy and rapid response, designed for wearable applications and real-time data visualization.  
**Role & Contribution:**  
- Developed visualization software to allow users to select and customize color maps, enhancing heat distribution analysis.
- Designed an automated water bath calibration setup with Arduino and industrial thermometers to validate sensor performance under varying temperatures.
- Conducted optimization experiments, improving op-amp circuits for better signal amplification and noise reduction.
- Utilized ECAD-MCAD collaboration tools to synchronize PCB layouts and casing designs, streamlining production.
